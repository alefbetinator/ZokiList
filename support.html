    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>How do I start using ZokiList?</h3>
    <p>When you first open ZokiList, you'll be asked to enter your name. This creates your personal task list. Once entered, you can immediately start adding tasks using the plus button. Tasks are organized into four categories: Daily Tasks, Sams, Woodman, and Other.</p>
    
    <h3>Can I recover my tasks if I delete the app?</h3>
    <p>Yes! ZokiList securely stores your user identity in your device's Keychain, which persists even after app deletion. When you reinstall the app and enter the same name, you'll have access to all your previous tasks.</p>
    
    <h3>How do I categorize my tasks?</h3>
    <p>When creating or editing a task, you'll see a category selector that lets you choose from Daily Tasks, Sams, Woodman, or Other. Select the appropriate category for each task, and they'll be organized accordingly in the main task list.</p>
    
    <h3>Can I use ZokiList on multiple devices?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use ZokiList on multiple iOS devices. Simply enter the exact same name on each device. Your tasks are stored in Firebase and will be accessible from any device where you use the same name.</p>
    
    <h3>The app is running slowly on my device</h3>
    <p>ZokiList is designed to work on devices running iOS 15.0 or newer. If you're experiencing performance issues, try closing other apps running in the background to free up system resources.</p>
    
    <h3>How do I log out or reset my data?</h3>
    <p>You can log out by going to the profile section (tap the profile icon in the top corner) and selecting the Logout option. This will clear your current session and take you back to the welcome screen. Your tasks will remain saved in our database and can be accessed again if you log in with the same name.</p>
    
    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <p>We regularly update ZokiList with new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Make sure to keep your app updated to the latest version for the best experience.</p>
